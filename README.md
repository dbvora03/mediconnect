# Mediconnect (In progress)

Mediconnect is a MEAN web application that simplifies how physicians and patients interact with each other. Studies show that one of the greatest problems in the healthcare industry is a weak connection between doctors and their patients. As a result, doctors sometimes struggle to provide an accurate diagnosis and an effective solution to treat their patients. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become very difficult for doctors to stay organized with their patients. Mediconnect provides a wide variety of services that strengthen the patient-physician relationship and maximize the efficiency at which doctors perform their day to day affairs.
